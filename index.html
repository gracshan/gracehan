							<h3>Network Traffic Engineering</h3>
						</header>
						<p><strong>Description:</strong> </p>
						<p> Network traffic engineering, 
							aimed at enhancing performance metrics like throughput, 
							fairness, and latency, was achieved through the development of 
							routing mechanisms in the SDN framework. Notably, SDN's distinctive 
							feature of separating the control and data planes was leveraged to 
							create an abstracted centralized view for routing decisions. The 
							linear program formulation employed decision variables, constraints, 
							and objectives, capturing the complexity of SDN traffic engineering 
							by addressing performance enhancement and network resource 
							limitations. 
						</p>
						<p>The algorithms that were focused on minimizing the maximum link 
							usage demonstrated an ability to distribute network traffic more 
							evenly, proving advantageous in situations where the consequences 
							of lost packets were substantial. Conversely, the strategy of 
							maximizing throughput was identified as the most efficient 
							approach for network performance. However, it was observed that 
							link failures, particularly on high-traffic edges, had significant 
							and potentially detrimental effects on the overall stability and 
							functionality of the network. Therefore, a nuanced consideration 
							of the trade-offs between achieving even distribution and 
							optimizing overall efficiency was crucial in the design and 
							implementation of the software-defined networking solutions.</p>

						<p><strong>Used:</strong> Python, NetworkX, Gurobi</p>

							<h3>ConnectOne</h3>
						</header>
						<p><strong>Description:</strong> </p>
						<p> The primary objective of the project was to address the challenge 
							of recognizing early signs of mental health concerns among students, 
							acknowledging the difficulty in identifying such issues before 
							they become overtly noticeable. Noticing this gap in available 
							resources, I collaborated with two fellow students to develop a 
							Google extension dedicated to monitoring and tracking mental health. 
							The extension operated through regular questionnaires featuring 
							key questions aimed at measuring mental health risks. The 
							innovation lay in its preventive approach, intervening in the 
							early stages to provide timely warnings and relevant resources 
							for assistance.
						</p>
						<p>Within the project, my specific focus revolved around crafting a 
							user-friendly interface for this extension. This involved the 
							creation of five landing pages using React, where I designed and 
							implemented dynamic visuals. These visuals were instrumental in 
							portraying users' mental health histories through 
							incremental progress indicators, ensuring a personalized and 
							comprehensive user experience. Additionally, the landing pages 
							incorporated tables detailing various strategies and resources for 
							stress alleviation. Through this collaborative effort, we aimed to 
							offer a straightforward and effective solution for students to 
							proactively manage and monitor their mental well-being, bridging 
							the gap between the subtleties of early signs and the resources 
							available for support.</p>

						<p><strong>Used:</strong> React, Javacript, Tableau, Firebase</p>

							<h3>Feature Detector</h3>
						</header>
						<p><strong>Description:</strong> </p>
						<p> A feature detector is a computational algorithm designed to 
							identify distinctive patterns, structures, or points within an 
							image that can be used to describe and distinguish objects or 
							regions. These detectors play a crucial role in image processing 
							applications, extracting meaningful information from images to 
							facilitate tasks such as object recognition, image stitching, 
							and tracking. I identified key points or regions in each image, 
							such as corners or keypoints, that exhibit unique characteristics 
							and are invariant to transformations like scaling, rotation, and 
							changes in illumination.
						</p>
						<p>To further enhance the accuracy of feature matching, I 
							constructed descriptors for each identified point. These 
							descriptors encapsulated essential features, facilitating a 
							robust comparison between corresponding points in different 
							images. This comprehensive approach aimed to ensure precise 
							alignment and stitching of images for the creation of seamless 
							panoramas. As a crucial component of the project, I also 
							implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the 
							matches between descriptors. This GUI provided an intuitive 
							representation of how distinctive points aligned across images, 
							enhancing the interpretability of the matching process.</p>

							<h3>Flight Search</h3>
						</header>
						<p><strong>Description:</strong> </p>
						<p> 
							In crafting a comprehensive flight search application, I 
							incorporated a range of functionalities to cater to users' 
							diverse travel needs. The application empowered users to precisely 
							specify their travel criteria, encompassing not only the origin 
							and destination but also the flexibility to input preferred travel 
							dates, currency choices, and sorting preferences. This granular 
							level of customization allowed users to tailor their search queries 
							according to their unique travel requirements. The emphasis on 
							user-friendly design principles and a well-organized presentation 
							of flight options aimed to enhance the overall usability and 
							efficiency of the application, empowering users to make informed 
							decisions about their travel arrangements.
						</p>
						<p>
							The user interface (UI) of the application was designed to adhere 
							to intuitive principles. The search results were displayed in a 
							tabular format, presenting a detailed overview of available 
							flights, including vital information such as departure and arrival 
							times, durations, layovers, and, importantly, pricing details. 
							To enhance user decision-making, the application strategically 
							highlighted the most cost-effective flight options, ensuring that 
							users could quickly identify the most budget-friendly choices.
							Furthermore, I incorporated additional features such as filters, 
							allowing users to refine their search results based on specific 
							preferences like direct flights or preferred airlines.</p>
